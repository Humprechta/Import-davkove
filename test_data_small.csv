So with truth - there is a certain moment when one can say, this is the truth and here I put a dot, a stop, and I go to another thing. A judge has to put an end to a deliberation. But for a historian, there&#39#s never an end to the past. It can go on and on and on.;A. B. Yehoshua;

My work is not directly about the social or political.;A. Balasubramaniam;
I enjoy doing my work, and I don&#39#t want to deal with the other things. When you enjoy doing your work so much, why deal with where to show, how to show, what to do?

I remember, in my first show in New York, they asked, &#39#Where is the Indian-ness in your work?&#39#...

I think artists are really the root of a tree.

I think artists are really the root of a tree. They can search for truth or reality in their own way, and the gallery can support them - the outside part of the tree, where it is more about reaching the outside world, connecting with the outside world.
